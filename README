Building LEDSpicer

Essential:
	build-essential
	autoconf
	libtool

Libraries:
	libusb-1.0
	tinyxml2

Debian/Ubuntu based systems just get them by:
	apt install build-essential libtinyxml2-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

If development documentation is needed:
	doxygen
	dot (for diagrams)

Prepare tools:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure

Or for optimized version:
	./configure CXXFLAGS='-g0 -O3'
I normally use something like this:
	./configure CXXFLAGS='-g0 -O3' --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
The data directory can also be changed with --datarootdir=DIR

Or for developers: will enable debug level 3 and disable optimizations.
	./configure --enable-develop
Developers also can add CXXFLAGS='-DDRY_RUN' to test without connecting to any USB hardware, will print the data to screen.
	./configure --enable-develop CXXFLAGS='-DDRY_RUN'
If no print out is needed use -DNO_OUPUT with DRY_RUN

then compile with:
	make

Optional install (needs root access except the destination is on a user's writable destination):
	make install
